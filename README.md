# Shopping Cart Test

The purpose of this test is to develop a functioning shopping cart. It should demonstrate your ability with several languages in the typical Web development stack. Build the application in such a way that you would feel comfortable putting it in production and comfortable maintaining.

You can use any tools, framework, dependencies, or methodology you desire. If you use a framework or dependencies, be sure to separate them from the source code you actually write.

To be clear, this shopping cart is like any other; it should provide a summary of items in the cart, as well as their quantities, subtotal, grand total, including GST and QST. It is a step before actually checking out, when payment and address must be registered.
